# SQL Practice Challenge

Aloha! It`s an engaging, worthwhile challenge for practicing SQL programming.

**Requirement:** An local database like MS SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL or others. I used MySQL for the tasks.

**Create databases** by executing the provided queries from the PDF document.

**Tackle the tasks** on your own, or seek assistance from the internet, AI tools.  
There`s a solution in a separate PDF document.

Additionally, **helpful sources** for SQL learning:
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/): **Main SQL queries with examples to try yourself.**
* [W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/challenges-1/index.php): **A good resource to solve some tasks.**
* [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction): **Lessons + practice.**
* Might add more, if i remember a source, or meet one.

**Cheers and happy learning!**
